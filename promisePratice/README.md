#Promise Practice
After attending my first SeattleJS Hackers meetup, I learned that I don't know enough about Javascript promises. I met Jon, the mechanical keyboard master. He donated a lot of his time to help me. Ultimately he showed me what I needed, not what I wanted. I'm very grateful for that. 

Rather than looking at my actual code, he provided resources and examples of how to properly leverage promises. Specifically, he suggested this as a learning tool:
http://es6katas.org/ // Learn ES6 by doing it. Fix failing tests.

He also provided two hand written code samples which I've named `promises.js` and `condensed.js`.

As of February 13, 2018 I don't fully understand how to implement promises in my code, but I will by February 20th. Now is the time to roll up mmy sleeves and deliver on my... on my... promise (•_•) , ( •_•) > ⌐■-■ , (⌐■_■)
